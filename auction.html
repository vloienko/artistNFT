Chicago’s practice spans painting, textile arts, sculpture, and installation and has explored the intricacies of childbirth (as seen in her “Birth Project” series, 1980–85), the possibilities of minimalist sculpture, and the relationship between landscape and the female body. Her most famous work, an installation called The Dinner Party (1974–79), is an homage to 39 influential female figures from Eastern and Western mythology and civilization. Chicago studied at the University of California, Los Angeles. She founded a groundbreaking and widely influential feminist art program while on staff at California State University, Fresno. Her work has been exhibited in New York, London, Milan, Chicago, and San Francisco and belongs in the collections of the British Museum, Moderna Museet, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Tate, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<br><br>Applicable sales tax will apply to all works shipped to and within the US.
